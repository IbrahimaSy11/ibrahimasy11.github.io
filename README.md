I barely used AI for this project. I mostly worked on the code myself and only used AI when I needed small help.

I used AI mainly to help me with:
- Formatting my code so it looks clean and organized  
- Asking simple questions like how to use the universal selector (`*`) in CSS  
- Learning how to create lines and basic layout styling  

I did not rely on AI to build my project or write my code for me. I made sure I understood everything I added and tested all my changes myself.

Whenever I used AI, I documented:
- What I asked  
- What I received  
- What I changed  
- How the code works in my own words  

This helped me stay responsible and learn instead of depending on AI.

## Science Fair Presentation and Reflection Questions

### Question 1 — Technical Concept Mastery

One thing I really learned in this project is **responsive design using Flexbox and media queries**.

Flexbox helps me line up things on the page and control how items move when the screen size changes. I used Flexbox to organize my navigation bar, hero section, project cards, and experience section. On a computer screen, things sit side-by-side. On a phone, they stack on top of each other so everything fits better.

Media queries let me change the layout depending on screen size. I used them to change font sizes, spacing, and layout so the site looks good on phones, tablets, and desktops.

For example, my hero section changes on mobile so the photo shows on top and the text goes under it. This makes the page easier to read and use on small screens.

This project helped me understand that websites should adjust to the user’s screen instead of staying one fixed size.

### Question 2 — Proud Challenge

One thing that was hard but I’m proud of finishing was making the **home section work well on mobile**.

At first, the picture and text were too close together and didn’t fit right on smaller screens. I had to learn how to use media queries and Flexbox to change the layout only on mobile without breaking the desktop design.

I also had to adjust the image size so it didn’t stretch or overflow. I tested the site on different screen sizes and kept fixing small issues until it looked right.

This taught me how important testing and problem solving are when building websites.

### Question 3 — AI Usage

I used AI only when I needed small help and not to do the work for me. I mainly asked simple questions and used it to help format my code.

AI helped me with things like:
- Understanding how the universal selector works  
- Making simple lines and layout styling  
- Keeping my code organized and readable  

I always tested everything myself and made sure I understood what I was adding. I did not depend on AI to build my project.
